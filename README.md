In my experience, many librarians are skeptical about AI tools.
In many cases, I agree with this skepticism, but I do think there
some good use cases. This is one simple example. Given a spreadsheet
of books, it tries to guess whether each book is in a particular
subject area or not (in this case, mathematics, statistics, or data
science) based on the title. It is, of course, not perfect, but
could be a great tool for a list which is too large to be worth
the trouble for human review. In particular, this takes about a
minute per 100 books, and this fast speed could be worth decreased
accuracy if it means the classification gets done at all rather
than not at all. One could also experiment with different models
and different setups to get better results.
